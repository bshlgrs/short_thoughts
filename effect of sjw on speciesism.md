What effect does the social justice movement have on speciesism?

Plus: people are empathetic, we can learn about how to make social change
Minus: consent, people only focus on themselves, perhaps it's very deontological

Are there any sane people working on this?




I think the most urgent issues facing the world are existential risk and speciesism.
