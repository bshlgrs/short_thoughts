I foolishly dismissed the beliefs of the activists from Direct Action Everywhere until I met them in person. I want to figure out what mistake I made, so that I can avoid doing it again.

I did that for two main reasons. Firstly, DxE disagrees with me on terminal values, in that they think that all forms of exploitation are wrong, whereas I'm fine with exploitation in general, I just disapprove of torturing animals unnecessarily. But DxE's medium term goals line up very well with mine: we both want to reduce speciesism by whatever means necessary. So this was a bad reason to ignore them.

More concerningly, I think that I dismissed their ideas just based on how they are written. I generally use the heuristic that I can ignore ideas about altruism which aren't expressed using the same mathematical jargon that I use ("terminal values", "marginal impact", "moral anti-realism").

I think that heuristic grew out of my experience hearing people talk about existential risks and global poverty. Givewell, MIRI, FHI, and similar groups are constantly arguing against people like Peter Buffett who don't use math jargon and are also blatantly wrong.

Maybe part of the difference is that global poverty and X-risk have way better thought out
