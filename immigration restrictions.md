Since moving to America, I've really started to realize how much harm immigration restrictions cause.

Of all the countries to be born and stuck in, Australia isn't a bad one. But not having American citizenship would be crippling to me. I'd have to finish my degree to have any chance of working here, and then I'd only be able to work at places which were happy to sponsor my visa. I probably wouldn't have my current job if I wasn't American.

Australia might not seem like an awful place to be stuck, but it certaintly has its downsides. I can make about twice as much as a developer here than in Australia, because of the higher salaries, lower taxes, and greater focus on ability over experience. I was offered a job writing Scala a few months ago. In Australia, there aren't many (any?) places which use Scala, and those jobs wouldn't be available to people who had never written a line of Scala in their life, particularly not people who didn't have degrees.

Silicon Valley is also a few decades ahead of Australia technologically and culturally. We have Square and Grubhub and Instacart and Uber and pretty soon we'll have self-driving cars and self-driving taxis. I'm about to move into an amazing group house run by a startup which creates group houses only in California. These things make a reasonable difference to your quality of life.

I have many friends who, by accident of birth to only Australian parents, can't conveniently come join me. As a result of what's basically racism, I'm going to make more money than them, working at jobs which are probably cooler, living in a city better than anything available to them. This isn't fair at all.

(Part of my love of America comes from me being privileged and high income: the tax benefits to me come mostly at the expense of the less lucky Americans. They'd probably be better off in Australia, and it's a shame they're stuck here.)
