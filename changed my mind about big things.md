I've changed my mind about a few big things recently.

I used to think that the most valuable thing I could do with my life is to make money and give it to good charities. However, I'm now less sure about that. I'm very unsure about the best way to improve the world, which makes it harder for me to aim my dollars accurately.

Now I'm more strongly considering trying to work on the causes I care about directly, at least for a while.
