What happens if the EA movement splits over insurmountable terminal value differences?

Currently, I feel like we stick together partially because by some gigantic coincidence, none of the different EA cause areas are obviously directly harming each other. At the risk of overgeneralization, I get the impression that:

- the global poverty people think that the far future people are probably wasting their money on stuff that doesn't matter or can't be fixed, and that the animal people are wasting their money on non-human animal suffering which isn't morally relevant
- the far future people think that everyone else is wasting their money on things which don't matter much in the grand scheme of things, or at least have unclear signs
- the animal suffering people who worry about wild animal suffering think that global poverty reduction has an unclear sign, and have wildly varying opinions about far future stuff, from supporting it to thinking it's a waste of time.

Plus, we're all happy about the other groups because we all make the movement stronger, and can cooperate on things like 80,000 Hours or whatever.

But none of us want to harm the other groups, basically by coincidence.
